<a href="http://www.destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/">Dynamic tree</a>-widgets to replace the standard archives, categories, pages and link lists. Support custom Menus too.

== Description ==

This plugin provides [dynamic navigation trees](http://www.destroydrop.com/javascripts/tree/) to replace the standard archives, categories, pages and link lists. They're widgets so you can setup the awesome tree navigation with drag & drop ease, but it also exposes several [new template tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dtree-30/installation/) for developers.

[Older changelogs moved here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/changelog/).

== Installation ==

1. If upgrading: *disable the old version first*!
1. Transfer the 'wp-dtree-30' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the 'WP-dTree' under 'Settings' to adjust your preferences
1. Go to 'Presentation' -> 'Widgets' and drag-n-drop the widgets to the relevant section of your sidebar(s)
1. Configure the active Widget to your liking
1. [Styling is done through CSS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dtree-30/faq/)

= For developers =

WP-dTree exposes the following [template tag functions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags):

* `wpdt_list_archives();`			
* `wpdt_list_categories();`
* `wpdt_list_taxonomies(); //needs testing.`
* `wpdt_list_menu(); //needs testing`
* `wpdt_list_pages();`
* `wpdt_list_links();`
* `wpdt_list_bookmarks(); //alias for wpdt_list_links`

They function a lot like WordPress own wp_list_* functions:

* They take an (optional) [query-string or associative array](http://codex.wordpress.org/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#Tags_with_query-string-style_parameters) with arguments
* They print by default, but if passed 'echo=0' they return the string of markup
* Most of them use the WordPress namesake for generating noscript-content

**Here's an example:**

`	<div class="dtree">
		<?php
			if(function_exists('wpdt_list_archives')){			
		   	    wpdt_list_archives('type=yearly&useicons=1');
			}
		?>
	</div>`

I've tried to keep the same argument-lists as the WordPress "equivalents" but there are some discrepancies: style- and markup related arguments are not applicable to WP-dTree (but gets passed through for the noscript content).
There is also some inconsistency within WordPress, like some methods takes `sortby` while others takes `sort_column`. I've tried for WP-dTree to accept both but I'm sure I've missed a bunch of these cases.

So, to find out what arguments are definetly available grab the default `$args`:

* `wpdt_get_archives_defaults();` 
* `wpdt_get_categories_defaults();` 
* `wpdt_get_taxonomies_defaults()`
* `wpdt_get_pages_defaults();`
* `wpdt_get_links_defaults();`
* `wpdt_get_menu_defaults();`

They all return associative arrays whith all arguments defaulted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WP-dTree looks horrible on my blog and I hate you for it! = 
WP-dTree 4.0 has almost no styles of its own - it inherits from your theme. To help you apply your own styling I've included a template CSS-file. Open `wp-dtree.css` and copy all the selectors into your theme's stylesheet. 
Now disable the plugins default CSS (from the Settings-panel) and hack away at your own file to make it pretty.

Remember - do not edit `wp-dtree.css`, as this will be replaced on every update of the plugin.

= Can I help you in any way? =
Absolutely! If value my plugins, please consider [sending me a book or two](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2QB6SQ5XX2U0N/105-3209188-5640446?reveal=unpurchased&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=standard&x). (used are fine!) 

Or perhaps some [games on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ulfben/wishlist). :)

= Why is there no "Show more"-link for Archives? =
First: a simple workaround is to use 'Folders are links' and 'Show post count'. This way a visitor can easily see that a folder has more content than is on display, and clicking the folder name will bring her to it.

The reason there's no "Show more"-link for Archives is this: [limit posts in categories](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-dtree-limit-posts-under-categories?replies=2) was a *paid* request and I added that feature to archives too because it was reasonably simple and actually helped me optimize the code slightly. The "show more"-link was a simple addon for the Category generation code, but not so for Archives - it simply requires a lot of data to be available where it currently is **not**. So until someone feels strongly enough to pay me for the inconvenience, I won't bother bloating the code for this rather narrow feature.

= Can I change the images used by WP-dTree? =
The images are all stored in the 'wp-dtree/dtree-img/' directory. You can change them if you like. Just remember to keep the names the same or they won't appear.

3. Archives, pages and categories (with post count and RSS-icons enabled).

== Additional Info ==

The original 'WP-dTree' was created by [Christopher Hwang](http://www.silpstream.com/blog/) in ~2005. By 2007 Mr. Hwang seemed to have dropped of the internet for good so [Ulf Benjaminsson](http://www.ulfbenjaminsson.com/) forked the plugin in and named it 'WP-dTree 3.0' (note to self: having a release number in the title was *stupid*).

The fork was focused on performance improvements - mainly caching - but soon expanded to add a lot of new features and modernizations; compatibility with WP 2.7 through WP 3.3, widgets, out-of-the-box Scriptaculous support, link trees, feed icons and more. 

For version 4.0 the entire plugin has been rewritten from scratch by Ulf, bringing it in line with the much matured WP 3.x API.
